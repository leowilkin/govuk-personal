# GOV.UK, but it's personal this time

Are you a well-seasoned open-sourcerer and love the work that the UK Gov Digital Services do?

Are you also like me and have a bit of a _thing_ for the GOV.UK Design System?

The only sane solution would be to turn GDS's production Design System kit into a personal website.
