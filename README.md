# GOV.UK, but it's personal this time

Are you a well-seasoned open-sourcerer and love the work that the UK Gov Digital Services do?

Are you also like me and have a bit of a _thing_ for the GOV.UK Design System?

The only sane solution would be to turn GDS's production Design System kit into a personal website.

## why it can't look exactly like gov.uk

> If your service is not on a service.gov.uk domain, you cannot use the GOV.UK crown logo.
> 
> It makes sense for public-facing services to look and feel like part of GOV.UK, so users know theyâ€™re in the right place. This is not necessary for internal services.
> 
> You also will not be able to use the New Transport font. Use the Helvetica or Arial CSS font stacks instead.
