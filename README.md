# GOV.UK, but it's personal this time.

Are you a well-seasoned open-sourcerer and love the work that the UK Gov Digital Services do?

Are you also like me and have a bit of a _thing_ for the GOV.UK Design System?

The only sane solution would be to turn GDS's production Design System kit into a personal website.

## Why it can't look exactly like gov.uk

> If your service is not on a service.gov.uk domain, you cannot use the GOV.UK crown logo.

Replaced to use a custom logo, or text.

> You also will not be able to use the New Transport font. Use the Helvetica or Arial CSS font stacks instead.

Helvetica has been substituted for GDS Transport.
